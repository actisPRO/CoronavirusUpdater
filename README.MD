Yet another useless coronavirus thing. Sends to your an email with coronavirus data for the previous day (with comparison).

**Data source:** https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

### Setup
* Create settings.txt file (fill it like the example).
* Create files with emails (they should be named Country-emails.txt, e.g. Czechia-emails.txt). Each string is one email.

### Running
Just `CoronavirusUpdater.exe country_name`, e.g. Czechia. It doesn't work for the US, I suppose.
